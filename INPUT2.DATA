******** DUMMY INPUT DATA FILE - TO BE SUBMITTED TO VMBATCH **********          
IF A FILE WITH THE SAME NAME EXISTS ON THE USER'S A DISK, IT WILL               
BE SUBMITTED INSTEAD OF THIS FILE.                                              
IF A FILE WITH THIS NAME IS NOT NEEDED IN THE JOB, AND A FILE WITH              
THE SAME NAME DOES NOT EXIST ON THE USER'S A DISK, THIS DUMMY FILE              
WILL BE SUBMITTED.  SINCE IT IS NOT NEEDED IN THE BATCH JOB, IT WILL            
NOT BE USED.                                                                    
THEREFORE, IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO CREATE THE FILES THAT ARE NEEDED             
USING THE NAMES "INPUTn DATA A" (WHERE n 1 to 3) AND DEFINE THEM TO             
THE BATCH PROGRAMS WITH THE "FILE" COMMAND.  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO             
DELETE UNNEEDED FILES; THEY WILL BE SUBMITTED, BUT WILL NOT BE USED.
